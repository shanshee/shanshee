Hi, my name is Londelle. I'm deeply passionate about computer science and currently pursuing my senior year at Southern New Hampshire University. Python has been my main focus lately, as I'm diving into advanced approaches to broaden my skills. Additionally, I'm eager to collaborate on projects involving C++ and other languages, and I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to turn innovative ideas into tangible software solutions. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's a project you'd like me to tackle!
